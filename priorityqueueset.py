class PriorityQueueSet(object):
    """Combined priority queue and set data structure. Acts like
    a priority queue, except that its items are guaranteed to
    be unique.

    Provides O(1) membership test and O(log N) removal of the
    *smallest* item. Addition is more complex. When the item
    doesn't exist, it's added in O(log N). When it already
    exists, its priority is checked against the new item's
    priority in O(1). If the new item's priority is smaller,
    it is updated in the queue. This takes O(N).

    Important: The items you store in the queue have identity
    (that determines when two items are the same, as far as
    you're concerned) and priority. Therefore, you must
    implement the following operators for them: __hash__,
    __cmp__ and __eq__.

    *   __eq__ will be used for exact comparison of items. It
        must return True if and only if the items are identical
        from your point of view (although their priorities can
        be different)
    *   __cmp__ will be used to compare priorities. Two items
        can be different and have the same priority, and even
        be equal but have different priorities (though they
        can't be in the queue at the same time)
    *   __hash__ will be used to hash the items for
        efficiency. To implement it, you almost always have
        to just call hash() on the attribute you're comparing
        in __eq__

    Note that for native Python objects (strings, tuples,
    etc.) these operators are already defined as needed.
